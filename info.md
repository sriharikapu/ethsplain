Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Tool that helps demystify raw Ethereum transactions which are usually one of the most daunting structures encountered when learning to develop against Ethereum. Using clear colors and directional lines, it breaks down all the subcomponents of a raw eth transaction. Works for both standard value transfer transactions and more complex contract interactions.
